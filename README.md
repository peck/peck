# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Peck.

I'm a technical people person with expertise in building & scaling distributed systems and teams. My favorite thing is helping people & organizations "level up". I'm still a unix geek at heart.

If you found yourself here by way of the engineering sample, welcome. We're often hiring short and mid term contractor developers for various teams and roles, and I am sure whichever hiring manager you've spoken with is excited to see the sample that you'll bring to the rest of your conversations with the team.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything that I can help you with.
