# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Peck.

I'm a technical people person with expertise in building & scaling distributed systems and teams. My favorite thing is helping people & organizations "level up". I'm still a unix geek at heart.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything that I can help you with.
