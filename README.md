# 👋 I'm Daniel Peck.

I'm a technical people person with expertise in building & scaling distributed systems and teams. My favorite thing is helping people & organizations "level up". I don't have as much time to code today as I used to, but I try to keep myself sharp and contribute to important projects when I see a need. I'm still a unix hacker at heart.

- Leading technical product teams
